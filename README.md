# Calc_ProtolExample

What is interesting here?:

1. MVVM
2. Reactive Cocoa 4
3. Simple calculator 

4. This repository is marked as the wrong language (like "Objective-C" but not a "Swift"), so I added ".gitattributes" files in my root directory and associated "*.h" & "*.m" -files (imported POD's files from RAC4)  as Swift language's file. (Some detail can see here: https://github.com/github/linguist#using-emacs-or-vim-modelines)
